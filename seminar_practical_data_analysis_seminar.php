        <p>Are you tired of the traditional classes in statistics? Here is a seminar taught from the perspective of data analysis!</p>
        <p>This four-day seminar is for engineers, technicians, and six sigma practitioners on every level. It provides a coherent, integrated approach to using the statistical techniques for data analysis in business and industry, combining the techniques covered in traditional engineering statistics courses with the process improvement techniques of SPC. It also incorporates the EMP workshop.</p>
        <p>The seminar considers the specific situations you encounter in your day-to-day work and lists the techniques that are appropriate for each. Within each situation, the techniques are arranged in order, beginning with the more general and easy-to-use tools and progressing to the more sophisticated and narrowly focused procedures. This kind of organization provides each student with a range of appropriate techniques to use in each and every situation.</p>
        <p>The result of this unique organization is that complete mastery of each step is not required in order to make progress. This makes the class suitable for both beginners and experienced users, with material that is useful for both groups. Moreover, by emphasizing when and how to use the techniques, this course complements any statistical software package you may be using. However, it does not require that you have any such software in order to perform meaningful and appropriate analyses.</p>
        <p>In addition to the survey of statistical techniques, you will also learn how to use the economic justification for taking actionâ€”the Effective Cost of Production and Use. By using this in a coherent, organized program of process improvement you can choose the right projects and the right improvement strategies. When combined with the knowledge of which techniques to use, this approach to process improvement makes you highly effective in analyzing and using data.</p>
