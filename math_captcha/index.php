    <h1>PHP Math captcha image</h1>
    <p>
    	Math captcha image form validation. All the captcha script resides in index.php. To implement this, all you need to do is add the captcha image to your forms ( &lt;img src="math_captcha_path/image.php" /&gt; ) and do the form validation.<br />
		Captha result is stored in session, so remember to start your session with the same name, if any used.<br />
		For this to work, you need PHP installed with GD support and ttftext. Remember to add the font used in your captcha.
    </p>
